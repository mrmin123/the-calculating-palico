the Calculating Palico
=======
**NOTE: This project is no longer actively maintained! If you have minor requests and/or bugfixes, however, please feel to open an issue ticket and I might be able to get to them. Apologies for the inconvenience! If you're interested in picking up the project, please feel free/let me know!**

**NOTE: As of 2015-06-12 (the time of the last major update) there is still no support for ranged weaponry, and I believe the calculations for the Gunlance and Charge Blades are a bit wonky. Please make note of this when calculating damage values for these weapons.**
